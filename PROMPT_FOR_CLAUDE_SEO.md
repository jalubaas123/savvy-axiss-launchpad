## What I Need From You (Claude)

Please provide a **full, implementation-ready SEO plan** that another developer can code into this React SPA. Include:

1. **Global / site-wide**
   - Recommended default title format and meta description (with placeholders like `{page title} | Savvy Axiss`).
   - Favicon and OG image recommendations (dimensions, format).
   - Any global JSON-LD (e.g. Organization, WebSite).
   - Canonical and hreflang (if we ever add multiple languages/regions).

2. **Page-by-page**
   - For **each** main route (Home, About, Projects, Courses, Web Development, Internship, Contact, Apply):
     - Exact `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` (and optional keywords).
     - OG and Twitter tags (title, description, image, type).
     - Optional JSON-LD (e.g. LocalBusiness, Course, Service, FAQPage) where relevant.
   - For **dynamic** routes:
     - Rule for **course detail** pages (`/courses/:slug`): how to build title, description, and optional Course schema from course name/category/instructor.
     - Rule for **project detail** pages (`/projects/:slug`): how to build title, description, and optional Product/Article schema.

3. **Technical**
   - Sitemap: what to include (all public routes, exclude apply/enroll if needed), URL format, how often to update.
   - robots.txt: keep as-is or add Sitemap line, disallow any (e.g. /apply) if needed.
   - Any heading hierarchy (H1/H2) recommendations per page type.
   - Image alt text rules (e.g. “Savvy Axiss – [section]”, “[Course name] – Savvy Axiss”).
   - Internal linking: which pages should link to which (e.g. Home → Services, Courses → Enroll, Projects → Contact).

4. **Content / keywords**
   - Primary and secondary keywords per main page (e.g. “final year projects”, “college projects”, “MERN stack course”, “website development for small business”, “tech internship India”).
   - One or two suggested H1s per page if different from current.
   - Optional: short list of blog topics (e.g. “What is a final year project?”, “How to choose a BTech project”) for future content.

5. **Deliverable format**
   - Prefer a structured document: sections for Global, Home, About, Projects, Courses, Web Dev, Internship, Contact, Apply, Dynamic (course/project), Technical, Keywords. For each page: paste-ready title, meta description, and JSON-LD if any.
   - If you give JSON-LD, use valid schema.org types and properties so we can drop them into the app (e.g. in Helmet or a dedicated component).

Assume the site will stay an SPA; we can add pre-rendering or SSR later if you recommend it, but for now focus on what we can do with React Helmet, a sitemap, and correct meta + structured data.
